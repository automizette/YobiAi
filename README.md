# YobiAi - Yobimo's best companion

A Discord bot made for the A&R Team, but better and with more features!

Thanks to YobiAi's simple mathematics skills and evaluation, YobiAi can evaluate automatically whenever a demo is approved or not. Just give her the score of the demo, and you are good to go! Plus, she has moderator and weird commands come with her! Oh, the score algorithm can be changed, by the way.

## Features

- Built by a label, for labels. With its simple (not perfect sometimes, but it gets the job done) A&R system, it can evaluate the scores of your A&R team and calculate the average score of them, giving you an insight into whether this demo is approved or not. Plus, you can execute a command on YobiAi to send a message to artists to notify them about the result!
- Comes with simple moderation commands, like kick or ban!
- Plus simple commands that can be modified, like the `/hello` or the `/links` command. Of course, you can modify them all however you like!

## Can I use this freely?

Absolutely! This source code is completely **open-source** and can be forked by anyone, used by anyone, or maybe you can contribute something along the way to improve the bot's capabilities! It's up to you to decide how you would use them, but as long as you know how to code JavaScript and Discord.js, you are good to go!

Some key things we need to point out though; The `.env`, `config.json`, and `node_modules` files and folders are not included in this repository for security reasons, causing some issues when running the code for the first time. We advised everyone to instead start from scratch when you are making a bot like this.

## Get started

**We recommend that you have at least some little knowledge to JavaScript and Discord.js as these preparation steps will not cover any stuff like putting your ClientID or Discord bot Token. If you have time, you may apply to [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java) to learn JavaScript for free, and also read the [Discord.js](https://discordjs.guide) documentation**

In order to get started, you need [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Code or any IDEs that you are comfortable using it. After, please install the following requirements:

- **Node.js** - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/en) _Must be Node v16.11.0 or higher_
- **dotenv** - Install using terminal by typing `npm install dotenv`
- **Extension** - (Optional) Prettier (code formatter for JavaScript)

**Installation and preparations (for those who want to fork this repository as a guide to make their own bot):**

1. Create a new folder on any location of your device, and choose that as your project folder. After, run this command in the terminal:

```
npm init
```

2. After, put the necessary information needed in the file then go to terminal again and run/type this command: `npm init -y`

3. Once it's done, install Discord.js through your terminal by running this command:

```
npm install discord.js
```

4. Then you are pretty much halfway set. To setup the bot, you can visit this documentation [here](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot) for more detailed step-by-step guide.

**Contributing**

If you want to contribute and help make YobiAi better, sure! Why not? You may request to pull this repository from the latest commit by executing the command

```
git clone https://github.com/automizette/YobiAi
```

Of course, new updates come and new commits is changing the entire codebase. So, to update it, just enter:
